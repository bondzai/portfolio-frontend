        title: "Harm Reduction in Decentralized Software Through Layered System Design",
        abstract: "This white paper examines how decentralized software systems can reduce large-scale harm without reintroducing centralized control. It argues that safety and freedom can coexist when responsibility is separated across protocol, client, and community layers.",
        problemFraming: "Decentralized systems often face a false trade-off between user freedom and system safety. Attempts to embed moderation or moral rules at the protocol level either weaken decentralization or create hidden central points of control.",
        hypothesis: "If harm mitigation is applied at the client and community layers—while keeping the protocol layer minimal and neutral—decentralized systems can remain permissionless while significantly reducing involuntary exposure to harm.",
        limitations: "This approach does not prevent all forms of abuse. Malicious actors can fork clients, ignore community norms, or operate outside curated interfaces. Cultural disagreement on what constitutes harm remains unresolved.",
        futureWork: "Design and evaluate a reference implementation combining multiple indexers, client-side filtering policies, and portable reputation signals to measure harm reduction without protocol changes.",
